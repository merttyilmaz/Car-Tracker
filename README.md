This was the first project I did with React 2 years ago.

At the time I didn't know much about React, so I butchered the code ut completed the app. Now I revisit the code and re-wrote the **Client** and the **Server** with proper logic and **Typescript**.

The app is a simple **Car-Tracking** app. It uses **Socket.io** for the periodic data delivery from the client to server. For the client, I used **React** with **Leaflet** to show the map and **Typescript**. For the server, I used **Express.js** with **Typescript**.

After you clone the repo, you can run the app with the following commands for the **Client** and **Server**:

    npm install
    npm run dev
