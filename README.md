# CAR-TRACKER

## The app is a simple **Car-Tracking** app. It uses **Socket.io** for the periodic data delivery from the client to server. For the client, I used **React** with **Leaflet** to show the map and **Typescript**. For the server, I used **Express.js** with **Typescript**.

After you clone the repo, you can run the app with the following commands for the **Client** and **Server**:

## How to use

1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the server
